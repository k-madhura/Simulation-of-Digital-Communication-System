# Simulation-of-Digital-Communication-System
The aim of the project is to build a TX/RX System with the use of memory, processing power cycles of the RX algorithm while keeping the quality of the system at the best possible level.
A receiver is designed to demodulate a frame containing 664 bits of data, every 50 msec. Sampling rate is 16 KHz and the signal is 16 times over sampled. The throughput cannot not be less than 83%. The baseband signal is 𝜋/4− 𝐵𝑃𝑆𝐾 modulated and passing through an AWGN channel with delay uncertainty of +/- 2.5 msec (5 msec total) and the frequency uncertainty of +/-1500 Hz.
